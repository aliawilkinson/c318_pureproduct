 How did Fenty Beauty nail the ultimate shade lineup? Obsessive research to create the perfect range of shades for all, exclusive insights from the world’s top makeup artists, and through extensive testing for real life on real women. 

 Fenty Beauty figured out that it takes the right balance of tone and texture to make foundation work on every skin type. We obsessed over custom pigment levels to capture your truest tones with a soft matte finish that’s just right—not too matte and not too shiny. The result? A comfortable long-wear formula that lets skin look like skin. Made for all women to love. 

 ""Foundation is one of those areas in the beauty industry that has a big void for women at extreme ends of the shade spectrum. There’s this middle ground that's covered really, really well. But then if you're very pale or if you're very dark, there aren’t a lot of options. And so, I wanted to make sure that women of all skin tones were covered so they could be included in what I created.""—Rihanna, Brand Founder

A unique combination of translucent base with micronized amino acid-coated pigments and mineral tone-balancing powders mimic skin’s tone, fusing with it for the closest match.

What else you need to know: 
Use a pearl-size amount of product. The foundation is concentrated in pigments and blends easily. A little goes a very long way. When too much foundation is used, the Skin Recognition Pigments—which act like magnets for long-wear benefits—may get stuck on dry patches or rough skin surface. It is therefore recommended to use an exfoliator to smooth skin's surface before applying. First apply foundation with fingertips, then buff in with a sponge if needed. 

 This product is also oil-free, fragrance-free, non-drying, dermatologist-tested, and noncomedogenic.

 A full-coverage, matte-finish, waterproof foundation that lasts all night. 

What it does: 
 All Nighter Liquid Foundation by Urban Decay provides full coverage with a modern matte finish that never looks overdone. Get all-night wear and a blown-out effect you never thought was possible for a flawless-looking complexion that looks amazing and stays that way. Perfect for all-night affairs, this innovative formula is also comfortable enough to wear every day. 

While Naked Skin complexion products are semi-matte, All Nighter Liquid Foundation is completely matte and oil-free. Urban Decay loaded this formula with an higher amount of pigment (about three times as much as Naked Skin Liquid Makeup), so a little goes a long way. There’s no need to build coverage or apply multiple layers. This waterproof formula diffuses light to blur flaws for beautifully perfected skin, while it mattifies and absorbs oil to reduce the appearance of shine. 

With a wide range of carefully calibrated shades that match Urban Decay’s existing Naked Skin Liquid Makeup shades, it’s easy to find your perfect match. Because All Nighter Liquid Foundation is so high coverage, it's important to choose the right shade. Just swatch the product on the skin, blend down, and allow to set to see if it's the right match for you. 

What else you need to know: 
 All Nighter Liquid Foundation comes in a sleek, edgy bottle that has a luxurious, highly metallized, gunmetal effect with asymmetric cutouts. As cool as it looks, it’s also practical; the shade is clearly visible, but the bottle never looks messy. It’s also equipped with an airless pump—so it’s easy to get out every last bit of product. 

Always shake well before use. Because All Nighter Liquid Foundation contains 25 percent pigment and provides a high level of coverage, it’s important to swatch it on your skin, blend, and let dry down completely to see the true color before choosing your perfect shade. If it’s a toss-up between two shades, go with the lighter one.
